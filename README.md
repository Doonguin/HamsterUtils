Easy customization for the ball texture in the game Hamsterball by Raptisoft

## Info to prevent any panic
The program will automatically create a back-up of the original files.  
These backups can be found in ``(folder where Hamsterball.exe is located)\Textures\backedup``  
So don't worry about losing any of the original textures.  
  
As a fail safe I will also provide a [copy of the original textures](https://github.com/Doonguin/HamsterUtils/files/11642068/backup_original_ball.zip) bundled with this program.  

## How to use HamsterUtils
To use HamsterUtils you can extract the zip file anywhere on your computer and than open the program.  
You will be greeted by this interface:

First, click the "select" button and navigate to the folder where "Hamsterball.exe" is located.  
  
After you have done that the texture image for the ball will pop up in the preview below the select button.

Now you can pick a color with the "pick color" button and hit "ok" apply this color to the texture.

And that is all there is to it.  
To reset the colors, just hit the "reset" button and everything should return back to the original colors.  
  
If for some reason the program did not create a backup, I have bundled the original files with the release and at the top of this README.  
  
## Common errors
This error is cause by the program not having access to the files. To fix this, run the program as an administrator.
