# HamsterUtils
Easy customization for the ball texture in the game Hamsterball by Raptisoft

## Info to prevent any panic
The program will automatically create a back-up of the original files.  
These backups can be found in ``(folder where Hamsterball.exe is located)\Textures\backedup``  
So don't worry about losing any of the original textures.  
As a fail safe I will also provide a copy of the original textures bundled with this program.  

## The is more to come...
