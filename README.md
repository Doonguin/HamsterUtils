# HamsterUtils
Easy customization for the ball texture in the game Hamsterball by Raptisoft

## Info to prevent any panic
The program will automatically create a back-up of the original files.  
These backups can be found in ``(folder where Hamsterball.exe is located)\Textures\backedup``  
So don't worry about losing any of the original textures.  
  
As a fail safe I will also provide a [copy of the original textures](https://github.com/Doonguin/HamsterUtils/files/11642068/backup_original_ball.zip) bundled with this program.  

## There is more to come...
